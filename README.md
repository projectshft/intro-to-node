# Intro to Node

## Introduction
The following is based on an in-person event, but has also been written in such a way that anyone could pick it up and code along! In this short lesson, we'll be build a simple API based on the "official" (unofficial) Star Wars API called [SWAPI](https://swapi.co/)! In the past we built a front-end application that uses this API and you can find that lesson [here](https://github.com/projectshft/swapi).

## Prerequisites
We're going to assume that you're a bit familiar JavaScript and how the internet works. If not, you may be a little lost, but we challenge you to give it a shot either way. At the very least, this code-along should give you an idea of things to learn next!

## Setup
For simplicity sake, we're going to be using [repl.it](repl.it). Navigate to [this link](https://repl.it/@AaronHayslip/Star-Wars-API) to get started.
